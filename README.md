**SonikDrop** is an open-source tool that streamlines the entire airdrop experience by letting you effortlessly create, manage, and claim token airdrops and POAPs, all in one place. This is to support and improve community reward systems making it cheaper and faster.

[SonikDrop Smart contract](https://github.com/youngancient/SonikFoundry) is currently deployed on 4 EVM-compatible Test chains(Kaia, Sepolia, Sonic, Morph) but we have plans to support other chains like Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Binance Smartchain.

We plan to support 8 chains, becoming a multichain dapp focused on improving community reward systems.

Currently, we are in our **building and testing phase**.
Launching Soon!
